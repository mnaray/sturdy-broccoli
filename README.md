## What's the game about?

In the game everything is randomized. That means:
- there are several textures that will build a player and platforms to form a level.
- at the beginning of the game, the protagonist and his enemies get generated out of random body parts.
- These body parts give the player different abilities. This way the game becomes rather dynamic and it doesn't get boring.

## What's special about the game?
- Unlike in many other 2-d platformers, the protagonist needs to collect something (not sure yet what) to finish a level.
- Since each enemy and the protagonist receives random body parts, each body part has a special ability, so the game is different for each player. (maybe we will once create a wiki for all body parts and their abilities)
