## What's the game about?

In the game is everything random. That means:
- there are several textures that will build a level.
- at the beginning of the game, the protagonist and his enemies gets generated out of random body parts.

## What's special about the game?
- Unlike in many other 2-d platformers, the protagonist needs to collect something (not sure yet what) to finish a level.
- Since each enemy and the protagonist gets random body parts, each body part has a special ability, so the game is different for each player. (maybe we'll make a wiki for all body parts, but that is rather unlikely)
