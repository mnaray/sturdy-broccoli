## Concept

You find yourself in the middle of a warzone between some ruins.  
The goal of the game is to cross the nearest border without dying, but that is not necessarily going to b easy. You can achieve this goal by taking your time to gather materials and food to keep yourself alive. There might even be upgrades to your base required to defend yourself from enemies.  
Once you feel ready to hit the road, you can head into the unknown in an attempt to escape the country.  
  
### Specs so far:
- top-down 2D-game
- items and gathering
- 32x32 pixel tiles in pixelart

### Yet to come:
- Some aspect of the game that is supposed to make it work with the title
- Storyline with more than just the finding yourself in an active warzone
- More details, features and ideas to the concept!
