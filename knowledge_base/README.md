# Knowledge Base

## Why do we need this?
The point of this folder is to gather notes and useful information for the project.
This way everyone in the group has the opportunity to check out notes and plans and other information that are in this folder.  

## Other reasons
Some of the assignments require you to write notes about a subject when you did your research. You're supposed to put those notes in the notes folder or save other types of information into here directly.  
You can also create a new folder in the knowledge base if you need to.
