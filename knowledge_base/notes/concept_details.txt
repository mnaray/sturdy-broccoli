--------------------------------
These are some details we wrote down for the entire concept
--------------------------------

Overall:
- Item system
- Top-down 2D game 
- Various eastereggs throughout the game
- Collectible ressources on the map
- Quests with rewards


Prologue (Probs a different file):
- Time before the war
- How did the character get there?
- Causes of the war
- How did the world look before?
- NPCs maybe?
- Story continues after prologue


Ending:
- Player has to decide when he leaves the base to unlock path to ending
- Alternative could be that there's a train exporting refugees and the player needs to make money for the ticket
- The ending should be hard to reach. This way the player can only leave, once he is fully upgraded.


Base:
- Make the base wear down after bombings, this way you have to repair
- Upgrades should be possible
- Storage space for Items


Map:
- Make the map static (always the same in each world)
- Hide some eastereggs such as 24th of Feb. 2022 as date in a calendar.
- Map adjusts to the progress of the gameplay. (Bombings destroy buildings for example.)
- There is a specific region the player can't exit before he decides to leave the country
- Different zones as towns and cities with NPCs
